Download the latest version of the 32-bit Windows Standard Distribution from the 
following URL and extract it into this folder:
http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html

Note: There is likely a folder within the downloaded archive named after the build number,
you should extract the *contents* of this folder. 

You should be left with a similar folder structure to this:
	/ext/CEF
		/cmake
		/Debug
		/include
		/libcef_dll
		/Release
		/Resources
		/tests
